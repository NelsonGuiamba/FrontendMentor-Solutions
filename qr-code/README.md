**Solution Description:**

For this solution, I used basic HTML and CSS, leveraging the power of Flexbox for the layout. The component structure consists of a container element that holds the camera view area and the decoded QR code information.

Here is an overview of the approach used in the solution:

1. Created an HTML structure with a container element and nested elements for the camera view and the QR code information.
2. Utilized Flexbox properties such as `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items` to achieve the desired layout.
3. Styled the component using CSS to provide an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
